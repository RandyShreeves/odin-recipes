Basic Recipe Website

This will be a very basic recipe website.
This is my first attempt at creating a website.
Hopefully, after completing this project, I'll have been able to practice basic HTML elements such as headers paragraphs, strong, emphasis, and the addition of links and images. I also hope to gain some experience in Git workflow.
